# Script to take CSV input and format each row as an HTML document. Originally
# written for anonymizing applications for the Waterloo iGEM Team that were
# received the spreadsheet output of a Google Form. The inputs are:
#
# applications_csv: CSV file containing rows to be converted into HTML docs
# name_cols:        Entires in these column #s will be matched with row #s &
#                   output to a doc called names_key.csv with the row #s. You 
#                   may need to remove multiple columns for anonymization, e.g.
#                   e-mail addresses as well as names
# grouping_cols:    Columns that should be used to identify the applicant by
#                   being added to the title. This script has a specific logic
#                   related to the Waterloo iGEM Subteams
# info_cols:        Not question-and-answer, should be put in rows beneath the 
#                   applicant info and subheading
# subheading_cols:  Pasted as a subheading below each applicant number in their
#                   HTML doc
# question_cols:    The column title is assumed to be a question, which will be
#                   bolded and followed by the row's value for the column.
#
# Default input values should produce decent results with the sample file
